/**
 * TamagotchiScreen.tsx
 * 
 * This screen implements the gamification element of Coach Ally through a virtual pet:
 * - Displays a goldfish tamagotchi with a mood indicator
 * - Visualizes the pet's mood based on user engagement (happy when tasks completed, sad when neglected)
 * - Allows users to interact with and care for the pet
 * - Provides options to improve the pet's enclosure and give treats
 * - Shows positive feedback and animations from the pet
 * - Displays streaks and points earned from task completion
 * 
 * The screen connects to the tamagotchi Redux slice for state management
 * and uses animations for an engaging user experience.
